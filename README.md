Data and scripts for analysis and figures for biogeography of Indo-Pacific protist communities manuscript

#### Metabarcoding Data Analysis
Data processed in QIIME2 (v. 2020.6) using the script outlined in `MetabarcodingDataAnalysis.ipynb`

#### Figure 1
Map of Indonesia and individual sampling regions, plotted in R and arranged in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 2
Protist community composition plots (a) by sampling region, and (b) by sample type and sampling region. Map of Indonesia from Figure 2a plotted using script for Figure 1, and layout of plots/assembly of final figure done in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 3
(a) Venn diagram showing the number of ASVs shared and unique to each region, (b) the taxonomic compostions of those ASVs, and (c) the proportion of ASVs they make up in the dataset and the proportion of total reads they make up in the dataset

#### Figure 4
PCoA plots by sample type and location, plotted in R using the phyloseq package. Final labels added to plots in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 5
A distance-based RDA showing how biotic and abiotic variables from our UVC and socio-environmental dataset explain the variation in community composition across our samples.

#### Figure 6
PCoA plots and barplots of dinoflagellate community composition constructed in R, final figure labels added in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 7
Overall protist richness, dinoflagellate richness, and diatom richness by location and sample type. Plots made in R and labels updated in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 8
Fish abundances by trophic group and sampling region, constructed in R, final labels added in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 9
Map of Indonesia with boses indicating sampling regions and arrows indicating surface current patterns. Map plotted using the same script as Figure 1 and arrows and boxes added to map in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure S1
Barplot for V9 mock community plotted in R and labeled in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure S2
Rarefaction curves by sample type and locations plotted in R.

#### Figure S3
PCoA plots by sample type and location with colors representing fishing restrictions at sites. Final labels on plots edited in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure S4
Fish abundances and protist richness by fishing restrictions plotted in R, statistics done using vegan package. Significance labels added to plots in Adobe Illustrator.
