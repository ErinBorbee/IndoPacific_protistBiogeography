Data and scripts for analysis and figures for biogeography of Indo-Pacific protist communities manuscript

#### Metabarcoding Data Analysis
Data processed in QIIME2 (v. 2020.6) using the script outlined in `MetabarcodingDataAnalysis.ipynb`

#### Figure 1
Map of Indonesia and individual sampling regions, plotted in R and assembled in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 2
Protist community composition plots (a) by sampling region, and (b) by sample type and sampling region. Map of Indonesia from Figure 2a plotted using script for Figure 1, and layout of plots/assembly of final figure done in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 3
PCoA plots by sample type and location, plotted in R using the phyloseq package. Final labels added to plots in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 4
PCoA plots by sample type and location with colors representing fishing restrictions at sites. Final labels on plots edited in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 5
Fish abundances and protist richness by fishing restrictions plotted in R, statistics done using vegan package. Significance labels added to plots in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 6
Overall protist richness, dinoflagellate richness, and diatom richness by location and sample type. Plots made in R and labels updated in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Figure 7
Map of Indonesia with boses indicating sampling regions and arrows indicating surface current patterns. Map plotted using the same script as Figure 1 and arrows and boxes added to map in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Supplemental Figure 1
Barplot for V9 mock community plotted in R and labeled in Adobe Illustrator.

#### Supplemental Figure 2
Rarefaction curves by sample type and locations plotted in R.
